## Part 1
1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?

2. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

3. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

## Part 2

|   The following code chunk will use the density function on the variable "Sepal.Length" in the data set "iris" and store it in the object "y".
```{r store y}
#given line of code
y <- density(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

|    The following code chunk will display the class, type, and structure of the object "y".

```{r information on y}
#create an R code chunk to determine the class, type, and structure of the object y
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)
```
| The graph below is made using the plot function on the object "y". The code chunk is hidden by setting echo to false. 
```{r plot y}
#| echo: false
plot(y)
```
