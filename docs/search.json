    "text": "What do you think being a data scientist is about?\n\nI think that being a data scientist means that you are a professional who specializes in taking unstructured data, organizing it, preforming some analysis or fitting to help enable a decision, find a trend, or predict an outcome. \n\nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\n\nOne of the largest differences between statisticians is the scope of work. A statistician’s primary responsibility is to preform statistical analysis on quantitative, numeric, data that is organized in some fashion. A data scientist on the other hand also deals in qualitative, non-numeric, data. Statisticians and data scientists share many task such as data wrangling, performing analysis, and making recommendations but the incorporation of digital non-numeric data such as images and categorical information is unique to data scientist. \n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\n\nI see myself as more of a data scientist rather than a statistician. While much of my field is based in modeling, analyzing numeric data, and probability. The incorporation of non-numerical data and other non-mathematical tasks in data science align with me more."
